# Resume Fraud Detection System

## Overview

A production-ready Python-based resume fraud detection system that identifies potential signs of fraudulent or malicious candidates during the hiring process. This system analyzes resumes using multiple detection techniques to flag suspicious patterns, inconsistencies, and red flags.

**Status**: ✅ **Fully Operational** with real API integrations

## Features Implemented

This system implements **3 comprehensive detection mechanisms** (exceeding the minimum requirement of 2):

### 1. Contact Information Verification ✅
- **Email validation** with disposable email detection and quality scoring
- **Phone number validation** with international format support (190+ countries)
- **IP geolocation analysis** with VPN/Tor detection and threat intelligence
- **Geographic consistency** analysis across contact methods
- **Integration**: Abstract API suite with graceful fallback mechanisms

### 2. AI Content Detection ✅
- **Section-by-section analysis** (summary, experience, skills, education)
- **Professional AI detection** using Winston AI (99.98% claimed accuracy)
- **Confidence scoring** with suspicious section identification
- **Fallback detection** using pattern analysis for offline operation
- **Integration**: Winston AI with intelligent text padding for API requirements

### 3. Document Authenticity Analysis ✅
- **Metadata forensics** for PDF and DOCX files
- **Creation/modification timestamp** analysis for authenticity verification
- **Creator software fingerprinting** to detect template abuse
- **File format support**: PDF, DOCX, and TXT with comprehensive validation
- **Security-minded processing** with size limits and encoding validation

## Requirements

### Core Functionality

Your solution must implement **at least 2** of the following detection mechanisms:

#### 1. Contact Information Verification
- Validate phone numbers, email addresses, and other contact details
- Check for disposable/temporary email services
- Analyze geographic consistency of phone numbers and addresses
- **Suggested Tools**: IPQS API, Abstract API, or similar fraud detection services

#### 2. AI Content Detection
- Identify sections of resumes that may have been generated using AI tools (ChatGPT, etc.)
- Analyze writing patterns, style consistency, and linguistic markers
- **Suggested Tools**: OpenAI's detection tools, custom ML models, or third-party AI detection APIs

#### 3. Professional Background Verification
- Cross-reference claimed employment history with publicly available information
- Verify educational credentials against institution databases
- Check for consistency in professional timeline and career progression
- **Suggested Tools**: LinkedIn scraping, company websites, educational institution APIs

#### 4. Digital Footprint Analysis
- Search for online presence and cross-reference with resume claims
- Identify suspicious social media profiles or lack thereof
- Analyze consistency between online persona and professional claims
- **Suggested Tools**: Social media APIs, search engines, professional networking sites

#### 5. Document Authenticity
- Analyze resume formatting and metadata for signs of template abuse
- Check for common fraudulent resume patterns
- Validate document creation timestamps and modification history

### Technical Requirements

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Input**: Accept resume files in common formats (PDF, DOCX)
- **Output**: Structured fraud risk assessment with confidence scores
- **Documentation**: Clear setup instructions and API documentation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures and edge cases

### Deliverables

1. **Working Code**
   - Complete Python implementation
   - Requirements.txt or poetry.lock file
   - Configuration files for API keys and settings

2. **Setup Instructions**
   - Clear installation and configuration steps
   - Example usage commands
   - Sample input/output demonstrations

3. **Documentation**

   - Rationale for chosen tools and approaches
   - Known limitations and potential improvements

4. **Analysis Report**
   - Summary of implemented features
   - Effectiveness assessment of each detection method
   - Discussion of false positive/negative considerations
   - Recommendations for production deployment
