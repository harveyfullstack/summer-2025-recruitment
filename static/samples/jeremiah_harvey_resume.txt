EXPERIENCE
Full-Stack Software Engineer & Founder | Cloakscreen Technologies, LLC
February 2025 - Present, Remote, United States
• Built a novel web technology to blind AI agents and AI-based cheating tools (Cluely, Interview Coder), incorporating methodologies from human perception and temporal motion constraints of hardware.
• Introduced the world's first web protection against AI, combining DRM + browser EME APIs, with a "trap door" approach and no detriment to user accessibility or experience.
Sr. Software Engineer (Contract) | The Walt Disney Company
April 2024 - February 2025, Remote, United States
• Implemented a three-tier recommendation engine with LightFM (CF library) incorporating weighted signals and progressive data enrichment via Snowflake- hosted interaction data (ride participation, guest preferences, and "must-dos"), achieving highly personalized recommendations and projecting significant revenue lift through increased guest spending.
• Engineered a cruise recommendation model using PyTorch, TF-IDF, and semantic algorithms to deliver personalized itinerary suggestions based on
Snowflake-derived guest preference patterns, creating a scalable ML solution anticipated to boost booking conversions.
• Built a park analytics dashboard ingesting Snowflake-aggregated guest interactions to reveal attraction preferences and visualize traffic patterns, enabling operational planning and resource allocation.
• Constructed an ETL pipeline using Airflow and Celery to transform raw guest data from Snowflake S3-staged tables into insights, enabling cross-park visitor behavior analysis.
• Developed a data visualization application using Streamlit and NetworkX to map guest journey patterns, identifying clusters leveraging Snowflake-computed schemas and movement flows.
• Led machine learning integration planning across business units, creating technical frameworks and Snowflake-aligned data share protocols for future
production systems.
